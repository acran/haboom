# What is this?

This is a procedurally generated Minesweeper game written in Haskell using the
[`Reflex-DOM` framework](https://github.com/reflex-frp/reflex-dom).

Instead of placing mines at the beginning of the game all cells start out with
an undefined state. Only when the player clicks on a cell to reveal it the state
of it and all surrounding cells will be fixed to either contain a mine or be
safe.

This way the distribution of the mines on the board depends on the actions of
the player and in which order the cells are revealed.

Using [`GHCJS`](https://github.com/ghcjs/ghcjs) this project can be
transpiled to JavaScript and be deployed as a static web app.

It can also be built with `GHC` producting a native executable using `WebkitGtk`
as a _browser_.

# How to install and build

## Using `nix`

The `reflex` framework recommends using the [Nix package manager](https://nixos.org/).

With `nix` already installed all required dependencies and compilers can be
download with the `try-reflex` script included in the `reflex-platform`
directory:
~~~sh
# install all dependencies and enter reflex sandbox
reflex-platform/try-reflex

# in the reflex sandbox build with ghc/ghcjs

ghcjs Main.hs # build as static web app
cp -r css/ Main.jsexe/ # add static assets to build result
# open Main.jsexe/index.html with a browser

ghc Main.hs # build as native executable
./Main # start executable
~~~

On the first run of `try-reflex` about 14GB of dependencies will be downloaded.
For more information see the
[`reflex-platform` documentation](https://github.com/reflex-frp/reflex-platform/#setup).

## Using `docker`

If you just want to build the project you can also use the included `Dockerfile`
to execute the above steps in a `docker` container:
~~~sh
# build image with name 'haboom'
docker build -t haboom .
# build with ghcjs in a container named 'haboom'
docker run --name haboom haboom ghcjs Main.hs
# copy build product from container
docker cp haboom:/haboom/Main.jsexe ./Main.jsexe

cp -r css/ Main.jsexe/ # add static assets to build result
# open Main.jsexe/index.html with a browser
~~~

When the build seems to hang because the output has stopped just be patient and
wait until the build finishes.

## Building the documentation

You can use `haddock` to build a browsable source code documentation:
~~~sh
haddock --odir=docs --html --pretty-html Main.hs Game/*.hs Gui/*.hs

# or using the docker image
docker run --name haboom haboom haddock --odir=docs --html --pretty-html Main.hs Game/*.hs Gui/*.hs
docker cp haboom:/haboom/docs/ docs

# open docs/index.html with a browser
~~~

This project was inspired by and heavily based on

[Kaboom](https://github.com/pwmarcz/kaboom) - a **cruel, but fair** Minesweeper
game by Pawe≈Ç Marczewski (pwmarcz.pl)

The files in the `css/` directory are copied directly from `Kaboom`.
